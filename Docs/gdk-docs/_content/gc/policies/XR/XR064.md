# XR-064: Joinable Game Sessions and Online Play \*

On Xbox consoles, titles that offer joinable game sessions must enable joinability through the Xbox shell interface. 

Titles that offer cross platform multiplayer with Xbox consoles from PC devices using Xbox sign in must also enable joins through the Game Bar experience.


## More Information
If a user is in a joinable multiplayer or co-op experience, titles must enable platform joins. A joinable multiplayer experience is one where players can intentionally play together. Examples include, but are not limited to, directly joining another player, sending and receiving invites, private lobbies and password-protected experiences.  If a user is no longer in an experience that supports joining, the user must not appear as available for joining.

When a user joins a game session but the experience is no longer joinable by that user for any reason, the title can choose to either:
* Ask the user to wait until the next opportunity to jump in.
* Give the user a clear message explaining the reason for the join failure.

For titles using the multiplayer activity feature for advertising joinability, they must keep the player counts, restrictions and groupIds up to date throughout the joinable activity. This enables the platform to help control joinability when full or restricted, and can group players together in the same joinable activity.

For information on managing game session using the GDK, read the [Multiplayer overview](../../live/features/multiplayer/live-multiplayer-intro.md)

## Implementation Guidance and Best Practices

Titles that have their own multiplayer implementation are encouraged to use the Multiplayer Activity feature to advertise joinability and invites with an activity. See the documentation about setting an activity and keeping it up to date with player counts, joinability state and more.

Titles that do not have their own multiplayer systems are highly encouraged to use the 2015 Multiplayer API flows, and must utilize the activity handle for correctly advertising joinability in the Xbox shell interface. For information about properly setting and clearing the activity handle, see the XDK documentation.

## Certification Test Cases

**064-01 Joining a Game Session from Outside the Game**   
  
>**Configuration:**   2 Xbox Live Profiles
>* Device 1 Profile A – Friends with Profile B
>* Device 2 Profile B – Friends with Profile A  
>
>**Test Steps**  
>1. Using Profile A, create a joinable game session.
>2. Using Profile B not running the title, access the Friends List via the Xbox shell interface and verify that the Profile A is listed as joinable.
>* It is possible that some games may only support private multiplayer sessions and therefore not appear as joinable for Profile B, in which case please jump to step [6].
>3. Profile B join Profile A’s game.
>4. Confirm that both profiles are placed into the game experience together.
>5. Repeat steps [1] - [4] with Profile B while the title is in a suspended state.
>* Wait at least 30 seconds for the title to fully suspend and for the suspension to interrupt any HTTP request.  
>6. Repeat steps [1] – [5] but this time, instead of Profile B joining through the Friends List, have Profile A send a game invite via the system shell to Profile B and make sure Profile B can receive, accept, and join Profile A.
>
>**Expected Result**  
>User B must be able to join user A’s game and progress into the game experience together. For games that only support private multiplayer sessions and therefore do not appear as joinable for Profile B, it is acceptable for invites to be the only mechanism to join Profile A. For multiplayer game sessions that only support joining the session via matchmaking (e.g. ranked matches), it is acceptable to not support joining via the Xbox shell interface. For titles that support cross-platform multiplayer, users must be able to join between an Xbox One Console and PC.

>**Fail Examples**  
> 1. User B is not able to successfully join User A’s game and is not placed in the game experience.  
> 2. User A does not appear as joinable in the Friends List via the Xbox shell interface because the game only supports private multiplayer sessions, and user A cannot send user B a game invitation via the system shell.
