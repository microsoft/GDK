Microsoft and/or its Affiliates will identify the software components of the Public GDK as being Sample Code, Redistributable Code, Third Party Software, or Tools by identifying the software file as belonging to one of these groups.  If any software file is not identified, then unless Microsoft and/or its Affiliates identify the file as otherwise, it shall be a Tool.

(d)	Installation. Licensee may install and use the Public GDK on Licensee’s devices solely for the Purpose. Further, Licensee may install and use the Public GDK on Licensee’s internal corporate network, if applicable, for the Purpose.

Any and all Feedback shall be subject to the Feedback provider’s underlying rights in the subject matter of such Feedback. The party receiving Feedback will not disclose the source of Feedback without the consent of the party providing it.
