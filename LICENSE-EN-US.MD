    (5) Reproduce, modify, and make derivative works of the Source Code Version of Tools, but only for internal use, and only to create and maintain one or more Microsoft Windows Titles.


(c) **Identification.** Microsoft and/or its Affiliates will identify the software components of the GDK as being Sample Code, Redistributable Code, Third Party Software, or Tools by identifying the software file as belonging to one of these groups. If any software file is not identified, then unless Microsoft and/or its Affiliates identify the file as otherwise, it shall be a Tool.

(d) **Installation.** Licensee may install and use the GDK on Licensee’s devices solely for the Purpose. Further, Licensee may install and use the GDK on Licensee’s internal corporate network, if applicable, for the Purpose. Licensee may make one backup copy of the GDK, which such backup may only be used to reinstall the GDK. Each such installation and permitted copy must be complete and include all copyright and trademark notices.

(e) **Updates.** Microsoft is not obligated to provide maintenance, technical support, or updates to Licensee for the GDK. However, Microsoft may, in its sole discretion, provide new versions, technical support, updates or supplements for the GDK (“Updates”). Any such Updates will be deemed to be part of the GDK and governed by this Agreement. Updates may be provided via the Download Site or another delivery mechanism chosen by Microsoft.

No title shall pass to Licensee in any of the components of the GDK. Microsoft shall own all modifications of, and derivative works based on, the Source Code Version of Tools (excluding derivative works based on elements of such source code that are either publicly available or lawfully obtained from third parties), including, without limitation, all patent, copyright, trade secret, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and Licensee shall provide Microsoft a copy, in source code and object formats, of any and all such modifications or derivative works thereof.

(f) **No Commercialization.** Licensee acknowledges, understands, and agrees that no Microsoft Windows Title may be published, distributed to end users, or otherwise commercialized except by Microsoft, its Affiliates, and/or a Licensed Publisher.

(g) **No Transfer or Copying.** Licensee shall not transfer, share, publish, make available, copy to, lease the GDK to, or otherwise permit any other person or third party to access all or any portion of the GDK. If and to the extent an organization desires for its employees, Subcontractors, and/or Independent Contractors to access and use the GDK in connection with testing and development of Microsoft Windows Titles on behalf of such organization, each individual employee, Subcontractor, and/or Independent Contractor must enter into their own Microsoft Game Development Kit License Agreement or similar agreement with Microsoft to obtain access to the GDK.

(h) **Excluded Licenses.** The license granted to Licensee hereunder does not include any license, right, power or authority to subject the GDK or derivative works thereof in whole or in part to any of the terms of an Excluded License. “Excluded License” means any software license requiring, as a condition of use, modification and/or distribution that the GDK or other software combined and/or distributed with it be:
1. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;
2. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or

(i) **Third Party Software.** Certain software components included in the GDK (including Redistributable Code, Sample Code, Third Party Software and Tools) may be owned by certain third parties and/or may be based on industry recognized standards or software programs published by industry recognized standards bodies, and certain third parties may claim to own patents, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights over such software components and over implementation of those standards. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement only grants a license to use the software components as described in the Agreement and it is Licensee’s responsibility to secure any additional license rights.

(j) The GDK (including the software and all other components thereof) is licensed “as is” and Licensee bears the risk of using it.

## SECTION 5 COMPLIANCE

Licensee represents and warrants to Microsoft that Licensee’s use of the GDK is in compliance with this Agreement and applicable law, including, without limitation, Licensee’s adherence to and/or execution of privacy obligations under the terms of this Agreement and as required by applicable laws.

## SECTION 6 NATURE OF DATA AND SCOPE OF PROCESSING

(a) **Personal Data Processing and Handling.**

    (1) The GDK may collect information about Licensee’s and its employees’ and Subcontractors’ use of the software and send that information to Microsoft in accordance with the Microsoft Privacy Statement located at https://privacy.microsoft.com. Microsoft may also periodically provide such information back to Licensee for purposes of assisting Licensee with the development of the Microsoft Windows Titles.

    (2) With respect to the Personal Data transferred under this Agreement, Microsoft and Licensee agree that both are independent data Controllers, and not joint Controllers, as defined in the GDPR, of the Personal Data that each independently Processes. “Controller” means the entity that determines the purpose and means of Processing of Personal Data.

    (3) In the event Microsoft provides Personal Data to Licensee, subject to a Data Subject’s additional authorization or instructions to the contrary, (i) Licensee will only use such Personal Data in connection with its direct business relationship with Microsoft, which is limited to the provision of games and game-related services; (ii) Licensee will not transfer, Share, or Sell the Personal Data to any third party except to contractually bound Processors or sub-processors operating on behalf of Licensee (where “Share” and “Sell” are defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act or other applicable Data Protection Law); (iii) where Microsoft transfers to Licensee data that is considered deidentified data under applicable Data Protection Law, Licensee will not (and will ensure that its sub-processors will not) attempt to reidentify the data such that it would become Personal Data; and (iv) Licensee will notify Microsoft if it determines that it can no longer meet its obligations under applicable Data Protection Law. To the extent the California Consumer Privacy Act applies to any Personal Data, Licensee hereby certifies that it understands the above restrictions and will comply with them.

    (4) Upon (i) termination of the Agreement for cause, (ii) investigation of Licensee by Microsoft or a third party for mishandling of data, or (iii) commencement of an Inquiry (defined below), Licensee will, at Microsoft’s request, immediately delete or return to Microsoft all copies of Personal Data shared under this Agreement except to the extent Licensee has the right or obligation under applicable Data Protection Law to retain Personal Data after termination. If requested by Microsoft, Licensee shall confirm deletion in writing within 30 days. “Inquiry” means any type of request or inquiry from a governmental, legislative, judicial, law enforcement, or regulatory authority (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission, the Attorney General of a U.S. state, or a European data protection authority), or an actual or potential claim, inquiry, or complaint in connection with the parties’ Processing of Personal Data shared under this Agreement.

   (5) Licensee must ensure its network, operating system, software, databases, and other relevant computer systems are properly built, configured, and operated to store, manage and protect any Personal Data received or obtained from Microsoft in a secure manner and in compliance with Data Protection Law. Each party will take all measures required in accordance with good industry practice and by Data Protection Law relating to data security (including pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR).

(b) **International Personal Data Transfer Requirements.** Some jurisdictions require that an entity transferring Personal Data to a recipient in another jurisdiction take extra measures to ensure that the Personal Data has special protections if the law of the recipient’s jurisdiction does not protect Personal Data in a manner equivalent to the transferring entity’s jurisdiction (an “International Data Transfer Mechanism”). The parties will comply with any International Data Transfer Mechanism that may be required by applicable Data Protection Law, including the Standard Contractual Clauses. “Standard Contractual Clauses” means the European Union standard contractual clauses for international transfers from the European Economic Area to third countries, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021.

The parties further agree as follows:

    (1) If the International Data Transfer Mechanism on which the parties rely is invalidated or superseded, the parties will work together in good faith to find a suitable alternative.
    
    (2) With respect to Personal Data of Data Subjects located in a jurisdiction that requires an International Data Transfer Mechanism (e.g., the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom) that Microsoft transfers to Licensee or permits Licensee to access, the parties agree that by executing this Agreement they also execute the Standard Contractual Clauses, which will be incorporated by reference and form an integral part of this Agreement. The parties agree that, with respect to the elements of the Standard Contractual Clauses that require the parties’ input, Schedule 1 contains information relevant to the Standard Contractual Clauses’ Annexes. The parties agree that, for Personal Data of Data Subjects in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, or another country specified in Schedule 1, they adopt the modifications to the Standard Contractual Clauses listed in Schedule 1 to adapt the Standard Contractual Clauses to local law, as applicable.

(c) **Schedule 1.** Schedule 1 describes the purposes of the parties’ Processing, the types or categories of Personal Data involved in the Processing, the categories of Data Subjects affected by the Processing, and the parties’ statuses under relevant Data Protection Law.

(d) **Attestation of Compliance.** Upon Microsoft’s request, which shall be no more than once per calendar year, Licensee will provide a written attestation to Microsoft that confirms and attests to Licensee’s compliance with the terms of this Section 6 and Data Protection Law.
